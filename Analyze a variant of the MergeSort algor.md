Analyze a variant of the MergeSort algorithm discussed in class that sorts an array into ascending order. Consider that instead of splitting the problem into 2 sub-problems, it is split into 3 sub-problems. Explain all the steps in this 3-WaySplit MergeSort variant and analyze the time complexity of this method for solving a problem of input n (assume for simplicity that the size of the input n is a power of 3) by:

·         analyzing the number of item comparisons in every step of the algorithm. Give the EXACT number of comparisons in the worst case and the best case. 

·         finding the recurrence relation for the number of item comparisons performed.

·         using backwards substitution (with the values from the worst case analysis) to find the EXACT closed form solution for the number of item comparisons performed.

·         expressing the time complexity of this 3-WaySplit MergeSort variant using the Big-O notation.

As a conclusion of your analysis in addition to all the steps above, answer the following questions:

·         What is the EXACT worst case number of comparisons for the 2-way merge (original method) and the 3-way merge (this method)? Which one is more efficient?

·         What is the complexity of the 2 methods? Express it using the Big-O notation. Which method is more efficient?

Place the analysis in a text file called Problem0.txt and include it in allfiles and then the pdf.
